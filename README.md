# ReEquip

A Skyrim SE mod that provides a power to re-equip every armor and weapon currently equipped.

## Why?

Some mods in Skyrim allow you to manage outfits, quickly changing out full sets of armor and weapons.
There is a known bug in Papyrus that does not apply the enchantment from player made items, This mod fixes that by Un-equiping and re-equiping that armor to allow the enchantments to be applied to the player.

## Usage

Becuase your meant to use this power quickly I have provided a hotkey approach to using the power.
Assigning and using the hotkey will quickly apply the power, cast it, and re-quip your previously equiped item.


The mod includes an MCM menu to assign a hotkey, and to toggle re-equiping armor and/or weapons.
