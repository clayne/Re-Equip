ReEquip

A Skyrim SE mod that provides a power to re-equip every armor and weapon currently equipped.

Why?

Some mods in Skyrim allow you to manage outfits, quickly changing out full sets of armor and weapons.
There is a known bug in Papyrus that does not apply the enchantment from player made enchanted items, This mod aims to fix that by Un-equipping and re-equipping that armor to allow the enchantments to be applied to the player.
I made this mod purely for myself but decided to upload it in the event someone else was having similar issues.

Usage

Because your meant to use this power quickly I have provided a hotkey approach to using the power.
Assigning and using the hotkey will quickly apply the power, cast it, and re-quip your previously equipped power/shout.

The mod includes an MCM menu to assign a hotkey, and to toggle re-equipping armor and/or weapons.

Important
This mod requires SKSE64.
